                            A creative agency is a marketing-based design firm that will often handle everything from digital design, content creation, branding, digital marketing, advertisement services, video creation, and web design. A creative agency can feature one or all of these services depending on the company. When most people hear creative agency they picture a company that is based more in design than data. At StarEgg, we combine the creative and analytical sides of the marketing process. Our focus on both of the essential aspects of marketing means that we will help you with everything. The design side is normally first and includes things like branding and websites. We also cover that developmental and technical side of the marketing spectrum. That means we work on everything from advanced database infrastructure to conversion rate optimization. In our vocabulary, creative agency goes hand in hand with digital marketing agency and web design company.<br>
                            We support every aspect of marketing in the digital world, you can see a full complement of our services in the “services” section on our website. But, we can run you through some of the more creative aspects that we work with most. Web design is such a huge part of digital strategy that it is nearly 90% of our overall creative work. All portions of our Philadelphia based web design play a role in the data driven side of sales. Our conversion rate optimization services are some of the best in the world as our experience in eCommerce is far more extensive than most other website design companies. We start by capturing new traffic and end with getting those users to fall in love with your product. We would love to discuss how we can make your users work harder for you!

                            Branding is the foundation on which any business is built. Many older companies are finding that they suddenly need to completely rebrand themselves since the older style of their marketing material no longer cuts it in the ever evolving digital world. We take that older style and transform it into something that clicks with modern design trends. We are experts in bringing an older brand into the present. Alternatively, StarEgg IT Solutions would love to help you create a completely new branding that will amaze your customers. It is undeniable that the power of branding is massive in the digital age. You can sit down in a group of 20 people anywhere and they will be able to identify the branding of some of the largest corporations in the world.

                            A web designer will take your website and turn it into something that creates more sales and performs better in search engines. Web designers are a type of digital designer that works on websites instead of exclusively on things like illustrations. A web designer is very closely related to a web developer and they will normally share a significant skill overlap. But, we will handle both the design and the development of your website. Design will generally entail the more visual parts of your site; the colors of your company, the layout of the page, and the way it scrolls are all examples of aspects which are covered under the umbrella of web design. <br>
                            Website development on the other hand is very closely related, but slightly more technical. Development in this sense means we create digital solutions to your digital problems. If for example, you end up building a custom website with us, the actual development will be the building out the webpages in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and many other coding languages depending on your specific needs. However, most of our clients prefer to use a content management system (CMS) like WordPress. This allows them the freedom to make more edits once the project has actually been completed and is fully in their possession. In the case a CMS is used as a base, the development work is reduced and mostly involves adding onto an already existing framework or tweaking it to do something specific that suits your needs. Our US-based web design team will walk you through each stage of the process to ensure you have the best experience possible.

                            It very much depends on the project! Some simple or local websites can be finished in about a week. Physical meetings in our Philadelphia headquarters or satellite offices often speed up the process. However, we’ve had some very large projects that can stretch across multiple years. Really the only way to know how long a project will take it so ask directly. For the most part, the average small business website will take anywhere from one and a half weeks to a few months. Our projects are broken down into a few different sections to help you better understand our roadmap. The first part of our process is the design phase. At the beginning we will speak with your company about what you were hoping to achieve with your website. This includes us looking at examples of what you like, what you don’t like, and other statistics like traffic or sales. Once we have a good idea of how our design can help, we go about showing you examples of what we think would work best for you and your company. The design phase is entirely dependent on how fast we can decide as a collective on the best course of action and really will mostly depend on you as the customer!<br>
                            The next stage is where we actually build your vision. This stage is almost entirely handled on our end, with some updates for you on what we’re doing. We give you the chance to look at our progress and offer your own perspective as we continue into the development cycle. Once your development is done and the actual framework has been completed; we will begin the simple additions and tweaks that make your website unique. We use open-source stock photos in our design but will add your own photographs as we continue. We also will provide stock content in most cases to help with your own process if you want to make significant changes. However, in our full-service SEO packages we will handle all of your content entirely!

                            Yes! User interfaces and user experience are major considerations in all website design. Since 2016 Google has decided that mobile devices are far more important for search results then desktops. That means that every web page’s UX/UI needs to be designed with mobile users in mind. Beyond just the mobile element the user experience and user interfaces of a website play a crucial role in the number of sales a business makes digitally. Statistically, certain types of pages will work better than others and the placement of CTAs, quote systems, and other elements need to be positioned and tested to find the best possible outcome for your user experience. All of our website designs are done with this in mind and our recurring clients are all given the benefit of our ever-updating knowledge on the best ways to drive sales on their websites. <br>
                            We offer a number of other services like application (both mobile and web) creation. Our mobile/web application development projects tend to have a much broader focus on UI/UX. The massive number of mobile applications on the market requires any company to be unique with the user experience. So, the role of the user is even more important in app design. Our design team features a number of UX experts that can go into more detail. If you require these services we encourage you to head over to our contact page. We can help!
